# Security Considerations

## Important Security Updates

### Django Version

**Note**: The requirements.txt specifies Django 4.2.24, which addresses security vulnerabilities found in Django 4.2.16.

The project was initially configured to use Django 4.2.16 as per requirements, but this version has known SQL injection vulnerabilities:

- CVE: SQL injection through column aliases (affects Django < 4.2.24)
- CVE: SQL injection in HasKey(lhs, rhs) on Oracle (affects Django < 4.2.17)

**Recommendation**: Always use Django 4.2.24 or later in the 4.2.x series for production deployments.

To ensure you're using the secure version:

```bash
pip install Django==4.2.24
```

Or install from requirements.txt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Environment Variables

- **Never** commit `.env` files containing real API keys to version control
- Use `.env.example` as a template
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use different keys for development and production

### 2. Django Security Settings

For production, ensure these settings in `.env`:

```bash
DEBUG=False
SECRET_KEY=<long-random-secret-key>
ALLOWED_HOSTS=yourdomain.com,www.yourdomain.com
```

Additional security settings to enable:

```bash
SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS=31536000
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE=True
SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER=True
SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF=True
```

### 3. Database Security

- Use PostgreSQL or another production-grade database (not SQLite) in production
- Use strong passwords for database users
- Restrict database access to localhost or specific IPs
- Enable SSL/TLS for database connections
- Regular backups with encryption

### 4. API Keys Management

**Google Gemini API Key:**
- Get from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
- Restrict by IP address if possible
- Monitor usage regularly

**Anthropic Claude API Key:**
- Get from: https://console.anthropic.com/
- Set spending limits
- Monitor API usage

**Tailscale:**
- Use auth keys with expiration
- Restrict ACLs appropriately
- Enable MFA on Tailscale account

### 5. Dependencies

Keep all dependencies up to date:

```bash
pip list --outdated
pip install -U <package-name>
```

Regularly check for security advisories:

```bash
pip-audit  # Install with: pip install pip-audit
```

### 6. HTTPS/SSL

- Always use HTTPS in production
- Use Let's Encrypt for free SSL certificates
- Configure proper SSL/TLS settings in Nginx
- Enable HSTS headers

### 7. Authentication & Authorization

- Implement strong password policies
- Enable Django's built-in password validation
- Use Django REST Framework's permission classes
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Consider implementing 2FA for admin accounts

### 8. Logging & Monitoring

- Enable comprehensive logging
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Set up alerts for failed login attempts
- Regular security audits of logs
- Don't log sensitive data (passwords, API keys)

### 9. Code Security

- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use Django's ORM to prevent SQL injection
- Be cautious with `eval()` and `exec()`
- Implement CSRF protection (enabled by default)
- Use Django's XSS protection features

### 10. Celery Security

- Secure Redis connection (use password)
- Don't accept tasks from untrusted sources
- Validate task arguments
- Monitor Celery queues

## AI Integration Security

### Google Gemini

- Don't send sensitive data to Gemini API
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate responses before using them
- Be aware of data privacy implications

### Anthropic Claude

- Review Claude's data usage policy
- Don't send confidential code to Claude API
- Implement proper access controls
- Monitor API usage and costs

### Headless Mode Automation

- Validate all generated code before execution
- Implement code review processes
- Sandbox test generated code
- Never automatically deploy AI-generated code without review

## Incident Response

If you suspect a security breach:

1. **Immediately**:
   - Rotate all API keys
   - Change database passwords
   - Review access logs
   - Disable affected accounts

2. **Investigation**:
   - Check all logs for suspicious activity
   - Identify scope of breach
   - Document findings

3. **Recovery**:
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Update all dependencies
   - Restore from clean backup if needed
   - Notify affected users if required

4. **Prevention**:
   - Review and improve security measures
   - Update security policies
   - Implement additional monitoring

## Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Django version is 4.2.24 or later
- [ ] DEBUG=False in production
- [ ] Strong SECRET_KEY configured
- [ ] ALLOWED_HOSTS properly configured
- [ ] HTTPS enabled with valid SSL certificate
- [ ] Database using strong credentials
- [ ] All security headers enabled
- [ ] Firewall properly configured
- [ ] Regular backups configured
- [ ] Logging and monitoring enabled
- [ ] API keys rotated from development
- [ ] No sensitive data in version control
- [ ] Dependencies up to date
- [ ] Security scanning performed
- [ ] Penetration testing completed

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email security details to the maintainers privately
3. Allow time for the issue to be patched
4. Follow responsible disclosure practices

## Regular Security Maintenance

Establish a regular schedule for:

- **Weekly**: Review logs for suspicious activity
- **Monthly**: Update dependencies, rotate non-critical keys
- **Quarterly**: Security audit, penetration testing
- **Annually**: Comprehensive security review, rotate all credentials

Stay vigilant and keep security as a top priority! ðŸ”’
